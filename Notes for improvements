Overview of project

In place of a readme


Quick note of explination, the program creates constilations by assiging a random chance of a particular star type being in a particular square, 
then moves that start a random amount up, down side to side.

Whilst it is scalable I should, at some point, stop refering to the spesfic stars and refer to database, so that other images could be more easily imported. 

Additional backgrounds would be a plus
